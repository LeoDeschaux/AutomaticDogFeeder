# AutomaticDogFeeder - High School graduation project - 2020

**The goal of this project was to convert a manual dispenser into an automatic one.**  
**I was in charge of building a website that would display data located on an Arduino Card.**  

***

**This project is divided into 2 folders :**  
<a href="https://github.com/LeoDeschaux/AutomaticDogFeeder/tree/main/PrgmArduino%20%2B%20filesCarteSD" target="_blank" >PrgmArduino + filesCarteSD</a>  
This version was made to run on an Arduino Card. In here you will find files that are ment to be on the SD card and a program for the Arduino Card itself.  

<a href="https://github.com/LeoDeschaux/AutomaticDogFeeder/tree/main/WebSite_Local" target="_blank" >WebSite_Local</a>  
A standalone version of the website that don't need to be connected to an actual Arduino Card.
